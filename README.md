# calculator
This is a calculator that performs simple mathematical operations using two numbers given by the user. The program uses the Tkinter module to run GUI windows to collect inputs, give any error messages, and display the result of the calculation.

The program tests whether both inputs can be converted to Decimal objects (meaning they are valid decimals or integers or are in scientific notation) and whether the calculation involves division by 0 or modulo by 0. If the inputs can be converted to Decimal objects and there is no division by 0 or modulo by 0, the program runs the calculation and returns the result in a GUI window.
